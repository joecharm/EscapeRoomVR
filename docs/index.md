## How can you get out while staying in, during the middle of lockdown ?

Escape Room VR is a fantastic escape room experience themed around lockdown, which you can play during lockdown, escaping in VR even if you're still a bit stuck in real life !

It is an immersive escape room experience combining thought provoking puzzles with realistic environments, set in a soaring cityscape.  There is plenty of VR functionality and interaction with puzzles of the sort you might find in a physical escape room.

This current release is a solo experience, but we'd love to hear your feedback and there are future plans to:
1. Host the environment to make it multiplayer
2. Play against your friends with competative escaping, leaderboards and teams
3. A range of different scenarios and supporting narratives
4. An expanded range of puzzes and tasks which will push you and VR interactivity to the limit
