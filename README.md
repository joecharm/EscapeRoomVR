This project has been developed as an assignment submission for **EG-M126 â€“ Development of Virtual Reality Environments**, part of **<a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/engineering/msc-virtual-reality/" target="_blank">MSc Virtual Reality</a>** at **<a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk" target="_blank">Swansea University</a>**.

It was developed in **Unity 2019.4.15** on an **ASUS ROG laptop** using the *Universal Render Pipeline*.  It has been tested using a **Windows Mixed Reality HMD**.

The 3D modelling of the room (and all the assets in it) was done using **Blender** and the city scape was developed using the **Scenecity** add in for Blender.

It has a range of VR interactables and uses particle effects, textures, videos and lots of things you can grab and shake about to create a virtual escape room experience.
